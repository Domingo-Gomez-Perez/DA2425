Exercise 1.43:
If f is a numerical function and n is a positive integer, then we can form the nth repeated
 application of f, which is defined to be the function whose value at x is f(f(...(f(x)))).

For example:
- If f is the function that maps x to x + 1, then the nth repeated application of f is the 
    function that maps x to x + n.
- If f is the operation of squaring a number, then the nth repeated application of f is 
    the function that raises its argument to the 2^n power.

Write a procedure that takes as inputs a procedure that computes f and a positive 
integer n, and returns the procedure that computes the nth repeated application of f.
 Your procedure should be able to be used as follows:

((repeated square 2) 5)    ; -> 625
|#

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (repeated term a n)
    (if = n 1)
    term
    (if > n 1)
    (lambda (x) ((repeated term a (- n 1)) x a)))
